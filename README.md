## What is Charlie?

Charlie is your own space - a place where disturbance and distractions are locked out.

Charlie is warm and inviting. Its calm and welcoming atmosphere allows you to spend stress-free alone time, diving into your favorite content.

It allows you to communicate with your friends, enjoying their short stories and images, without noisy notifications and screaming colors.

When life gets too fussy - Charlie is your escape!
